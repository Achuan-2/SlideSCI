## üìù Development Background

Does anyone else share my long-standing grievances with PowerPoint? üò°:

üíî **No Image Titles**: Unlike Word, you can't directly add titles to images. You have to manually insert text boxes and spend ages aligning them, only to end up with crooked results!

üíî **No Copy-Paste Element Positioning**: To keep similar elements in the same position across different slides, you have to copy-paste and modify each time. No way to copy-paste positions directly!

üíî **No Auto-Align for Images**: Insert multiple images and want them neatly arranged in rows and columns? Either drag each one manually for eternity or align them column by column horizontally and then vertically.

üíî **No Code Block Insertion**: You have to copy-paste from external editors (like VSCode) or specialized websites, or screenshot code blocks as images. So tedious!

üíî **No LaTeX Math Formula Support**: Nowadays, I rely on AI to recognize and generate math formulas in LaTeX format, which can't be directly pasted into PPT.

...

Most PPT plugins on the market are packed with flashy but impractical features. As a graduate student, I need to create clear, content-focused progress reports quickly every week‚Äîaesthetics are secondary.

With AI's help, I developed solutions for these pain points swiftly! The sense of accomplishment is real! (Over 99% of this plugin's code was AI-generated. Thank you, AI sensei!)

In the spirit of open source, this plugin is available on GitHub. Stars are appreciated! üåü

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Batch Add Image Titles**: <u>Batch</u> select images and add centered captions below them. Supports auto-grouping images and titles.

  ![](https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/Achuan-2/PicBed/assets/20250116004806-2025-01-16.png)
* **Auto-Arrange Images**: Automatically align multiple images. Set columns per row, column spacing, row spacing (defaults to column spacing), and image dimensions.

  * If width/height isn't set, the first image's height is used for alignment.
  * Enable "Arrange by Position" to auto-detect order based on manual placement. Otherwise, uses the selection order.

## ü™ü Supported Environments

Developed on Windows 11 using [Visual Studio Tools for Office](https://www.visualstudio.com/de/vs/office-tools/) and C#. Designed for Microsoft PowerPoint. Compatible with WPS (note: WPS does not support LaTeX formulas or Markdown insertion).

**Windows only**. No Mac support.

## üñ•Ô∏è Installation

1. Download `msi` file from the GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/Achuan-2/my_ppt_plugin/releases).
2. Extract and double-click to install.

**Note**: Close PowerPoint before installation. Otherwise, the plugin won't load immediately.

**Required Dependencies**:
- [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0+](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/download/details.aspx?id=17718)
- [Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Tools for Office Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/download/details.aspx?id=105522)

If the plugin fails to load (e.g., "Runtime error loading COM add-in"), install the dependencies above.

## ‚ùì FAQs

* **How to add plugin features to the Quick Access Toolbar?**  
  Right-click a button and select "Add to Quick Access Toolbar."  
  ![](https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/Achuan-2/PicBed/assets/PixPin_2025-01-16_16-56-07-2025-01-16.png)  
  Move the Quick Access Toolbar below the ribbon for easier access.
* **Caption text boxes aren't centered or lack proper width?**  
  Set a default text box: Widen the caption, center it, then set it as the default.
* **LaTeX formulas display incorrectly?**  
  Best for single-line formulas. For complex multi-line formulas, use [IguanaTex](https://github.com/Jonathan-LeRoux/IguanaTex).
